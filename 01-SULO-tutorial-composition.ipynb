In contrast, **contains** describes a spatial or topological relation of inclusion, where one object occupies space within another but remains independent of it. For example, an oven contains a pizza while baking, or a pizza box contains a pizza during delivery, but neither the oven nor the box becomes part of the pizza. Thus, **hasPart** is transitive, compositional, and identity-defining, while **contains** is contextual, spatial, and non-constitutive—one relates to structure, the other to location.\n",
