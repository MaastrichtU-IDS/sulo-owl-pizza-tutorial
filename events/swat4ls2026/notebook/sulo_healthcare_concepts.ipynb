Measurements are always connected to sume qualitative and quantitative value (+ unit).\n",

        "Along this tutorial we will represent an administrative case which describes a patient's encounter or stay at a healthcare provider institution. It can contain all clinical processes associated with the patient stay. E.g the admission and discharge events, observations, diagnoses, treatments or any assessment made to a patient. It may also include additional information such as the subject of care, or the location where the encounter or stay takes place.\n",

        "Our administrative case will represent a care episode that includes the patient's admission to, and subsequent discharge from the healthcare facility. During the encounter, the patient's blood pressure is measured, and hypertension is diagnosed. The case will also document the dministration of medication and the issuance of a prescription for continued treatment following discharge.\n",

A direct reference from an OWL class to another OWL class is not available in OWL-DL (it would require so-called punning).
